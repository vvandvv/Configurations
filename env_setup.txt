Only in windows:

/
if you installed the git, you will find the / is set to /path/to/where/you/install/git in your git-bash,
but not in your cmd console. you need to create GIT_HOME with the the value above.

~
with git installed, this will be /path/to/your/user/directory/under/windows, like c:\users\andy.
you don't need to create HOME as corresponding.

VIM
this is not set, so you need to create it manually, set it to /path/to/where/you/install/vim

VIMRUNTIME
set to $VIM/vim74 or the version(74) may be different.
if you don't set it, you will use the default git-vim.

PATH
add the VIMRUNTIME and the GIT_HOME\bin to use vim and git under cmd. you can also use other staffs by doing this.
you can add those two in your ENV not the global.

solve the ls command show chinese charactors properly:
in git-bash: alias ls='ls --show-control-chars --color=auto', set it in you .bashrc file.
in cmd: doskey ls=ls --show-control-chars --color=auto $*

github cannot use git protocol(perhaps in MIC only):
using https, you can set proxy by add
	export https_proxy='https://11210240012:201118@proxy.fudan.edu.cn:8080/'
to your .bashrc file.

the _vimrc file contains lots of lines to solve encoding problems, but i haven't listed them here by now, perhaps later.
